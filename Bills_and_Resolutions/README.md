# Bills and Resolutions Collection

This collection contains files of MARC records for House and Senate bills and resolutions generated from the MODS metadata of the GovInfo [Congressional Bills Collection](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BILLS). Our main goals are to provide access to these publications that MCS does not currently catalog and to develop a new product for the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) community. The process includes all types of House and Senate legislation:

- Bills
- Concurrent resolutions
- Joint resolutions
- Simple resolutions

The first set of records are for the 256 House bills and resolutions published in August in GovInfo. The records contain OCLC numbers and Superintendent of Documents Classification numbers. The files are available in MARC and MARC XML files in UTF-8 encoding. During the six-month beta period, we will post monthly files of new records and cumulative files of previously posted records. After the beta period, we would post quarterly files of new records and the cumulative files.

The publications are cataloged as integrating resources based on the introduced versions of the bills and resolutions. The intention of this treatment is to make the records a starting point for information about the versions that are published and the actions that occur during the legislative process. Therefore, the records are linked to the great resources on GovInfo (PURLs to the related documents page) and Congress.gov (URLs to the summary page) for each measure. The records may be retrieved by the CGP expert mode search: [wlts=BILLSRESOLUTIONS](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=wlts%3Dbillsresolutions&x=55&y=15).

MCS estimates that there will be approximately 10,000-15,000 records per Congress. As the beta period proceeds, we will periodically issue news alerts with updates about the initiative and will report data about the records and the process on the LSCM Library Technical Services Information Portal [LibGuide](https://libguides.fdlp.gov/c.php?g=1119222&p=9009927).

MCS would like to emphasize that this is the first iteration of the process. MCS will evaluate each group of records and will work to enhance the metadata. MCS is aware of several issues, such as the capitalization of title words and the broad application of the Library of Congress subject headings and Congress.gov Policy Areas terms. MCS welcomes recommendations and comments via [askGPO](https://ask.gpo.gov/s/) inquiries in the "Cataloging/Metadata (Policies and Records)" category.
