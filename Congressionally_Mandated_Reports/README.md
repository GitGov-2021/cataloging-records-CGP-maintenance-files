# Congressionally Mandated Reports

Federal agencies must now submit congressionally mandated reports to GPO in compliance with the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act, after first submitting to Congress or any required committee or subcommittee of Congress. As of September 4, 2024, 482 congressionally mandated reports have been published and made available to the public on GPOâ€™s online system of access, GovInfo.

As of September 4, 2024, Metadata and Collection Services (MCS) has cataloged 264 records for congressionally mandated reports in the [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov/). The records are based on the MODS metadata of the GovInfo [Congressionally Mandated Reports collection](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/cmr). MCS staff members complete and authenticate the records for the Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC). The records may be retrieved in the CGP by the expert mode search: [WLTS=CMR](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=wlts%3Dcmr&x=0&y=0).

This collection contains the 201 records added to the CGP in June and July 2024. The records are available in MARC UTF-8 and XML files.
