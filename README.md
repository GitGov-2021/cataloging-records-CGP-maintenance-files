# Cataloging-records-CGP-maintenance-files

Library Services & Content Management (LSCM) of the [United States Government Publishing Office (GPO)](https://www.gpo.gov) has created this repository to offer files of MARC bibliographic records of the [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F) for downloading free of charge. The CGP is the GPO’s finding tool for publications of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and other entities of the U.S. Federal Government. The CGP records comprise the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications and contain descriptive and subject information to enable the discovery of these resources. Many CGP records provide PURL (persistent uniform resource locator) links to the online versions of publications. For more information, please visit the [CGP help pages](https://catalog.gpo.gov/cgphelp/en/help.html).

These files can be used for catalog maintenance purposes, such as adding new records, replacing changed records, and removing records that LSCM deleted from the CGP. We are transitioning these files from the [CGP on GitHub repository](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records). We will maintain the CGP monthly files in the CGP on GitHub repository until May 1, 2023. At that point, we will make the files available only in this repository.

This repository contains six monthly sets of new and updated catalog records, which are available in UTF-8, MARC-8, and MARCXML formats, and text files with the OCLC and CGP system numbers of the records deleted from the CGP. The naming conventions of the files are as follows: “cataloging_records-YYYYMM_####_format.mrc”. The abbreviation YYYYMM stands for the year and month, and #### represents the number of bibliographic records in the record set. Format indicates if the character set is in UTF-8, MARC-8, or MARCXML format.

Each of the files includes the following categories of bibliographic records:

- Records created/updated by the LTS staff with valid OCLC numbers
- Records created/updated as part of the Historic Shelflist project
- Newly created/updated brief bibliographic records.

The repository also includes .txt and .csv files of the CGP system numbers and/or OCLC numbers of the records that LSCM has removed from the CGP for various reasons.

To download the files, use the “Code” button in the right-hand section of this page and select “Download ZIP.” The ZIP file contains all of the files in the repository.
