# Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) Records Maintenance Files

Library Services & Content Management (LSCM) of the [United States Government Publishing Office (GPO)](https://www.gpo.gov) created this repository to offer files of MARC bibliographic records of the [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F) for downloading free of charge. Library Technical Services (LTS), a department of LSCM, manages the resources in this repository. The CGP is the GPO’s finding tool for publications of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and other entities of the U.S. Federal Government. The CGP records comprise the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications and contain descriptive and subject information to enable the discovery of these resources. Many CGP records provide PURL (persistent uniform resource locator) links to the online versions of publications. For more information, please visit the [CGP help pages](https://catalog.gpo.gov/cgphelp/en/help.html).

These files can be used for catalog maintenance purposes, such as adding new records, replacing changed records, and removing records that LSCM deleted from the CGP. We are transitioning these files from the [CGP on GitHub repository](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records). We will maintain the CGP monthly files in the CGP on GitHub repository until June 1, 2023. At that point, we will make the files available only in this repository.

This repository contains two collections: CGP Records Monthly Files and Online Version Records without Item Numbers. We plan to add more collections in the near future.

LSCM produces an annual set of files of the new and changed CGP records of each calendar year. LTS generally posts the files of the records during the following February. LTS posts the files in these repositories: [All CGP Records (MARC)](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-all-cgp-utf8) and [All CGP Records (MARC XML)](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-all-cgp-marcxml). LTS retains the monthly files in the CGP Records Monthly Files collection of this repository posted during the year between each annual set of all CGP records.
