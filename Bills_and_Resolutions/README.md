# Bills and Resolutions Collection


This collection contains files of [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications](https://catalog.gpo.gov/) (CGP) MARC records for House and Senate bills and resolutions generated from the MODS metadata of the [GovInfo Congressional Bills Collection](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BILLS). Our main goals are to provide access to these publications that MCS does not currently catalog and to develop a new product for the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) community. The process includes all types of House and Senate legislation:

- Bills
- Concurrent resolutions
- Joint resolutions
- Simple resolutions

The collection contains the 4,746 House and Senate bills and resolutions introduced from August 2023 through March 2024. During the beta period, we will post files of records as we make them available in the CGP and OCLC. We will periodically issue news alerts about the process and post updates on the LSCM Metadata and Collection Services Information Portal [Resource Guide](https://libguides.fdlp.gov/lscm-metadata-and-collection-services/what-is-new).

Please note: There are eight records in the CGP that we cataloged to test the process. These bills and resolutions were introduced in January-March 2023. The records are not included in the files of this collection.

The records contain OCLC numbers and Superintendent of Documents Classification numbers. The files are available in MARC and MARC XML in UTF-8 encoding. The publications are cataloged as integrating resources based on the introduced versions of the bills and resolutions. The intention of this treatment is to make the records a starting point for information about the versions that are published and the actions that occur during the legislative process. Therefore, the records are linked to the great resources on GovInfo (PURLs to the related documents page) and Congress.gov (URLs to the summary page) for each measure. The records may be retrieved by the CGP expert mode search: [wlts=BILLSRESOLUTIONS](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=wlts%3Dbillsresolutions&x=55&y=15.)

MCS would like to emphasize that we are in the initial phase of the process. MCS will continue to evaluate the records and to enhance the metadata. MCS is aware of several issues, such as the capitalization of title words and the broad application of the Library of Congress subject headings and Congress.gov Policy Areas terms. 
MCS is very interested in hearing from you about your experience using these records and others in our GitHub repositories. MCS welcomes recommendations and comments via [askGPO](https://ask.gpo.gov/s/) inquiries in the "Cataloging/Metadata (Policies and Records)" category.
