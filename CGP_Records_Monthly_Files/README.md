# CGP Records Monthly Files

This collection contains the monthly files of new and changed Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) records posted during the year between each annual set of all CGP records. The records are available in three types of files:

- Combined new and changed records
- Changed records only
- New records only
- Online changed records
- Online new records
- Tangible changed records
- Tangible new records

The records are available in UTF-8, MARC-8, and MARCXML formats. The naming conventions of the files are as follows: `cataloging_records-YYYYMM_####_format.mrc`. The abbreviation `YYYYMM` stands for the year and month, and `####` represents the number of bibliographic records in the record set. `Format` indicates if the character set is in UTF-8, MARC-8, or MARC XML format.

Each of the files includes the following categories of bibliographic records:

- Records created or changed by the MCS staff with valid OCLC numbers
- Records created/updated as part of the Historic Shelflist project

The collection also includes `.txt` files with the OCLC and CGP system numbers of the records deleted from the CGP.
